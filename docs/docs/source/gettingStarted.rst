SNEEP is fast method to identify regulatory non-coding SNPs (rSNPs) that modify the binding sites of Transcription Factors (TFs) for large collections of SNPs provided by the user. SNEEP combines our statistical approach introduced in our preprint `A statistical approach to identify regulatory DNA variants <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.31.526404v1>`_ with epigenetic data and additional functionalities.

A graphical summary of SNEEP is shown below:
